# Plan

## Acceptance criteria
- Publish-ready audit doc produced at ops/RUNS/2026-02-12T213751Z__seo-audit__seo-audit-HillCoPaint/05_outputs/seo-audit.md
- Includes technical + content findings, prioritized backlog, and evidence references
- No invented metrics; all claims cite source (GSC export/screenshots/crawl logs)

## Steps
1) Confirm scope + access (GSC property, crawl scope)
2) Collect evidence (GSC exports, site crawl, performance checks)
3) Draft findings + prioritized backlog
4) QA pass (no hallucinated metrics, links verified)
